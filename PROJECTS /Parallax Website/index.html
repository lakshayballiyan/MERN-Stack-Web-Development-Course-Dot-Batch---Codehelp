            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is an adventure sport and recreational activity that involves flying a lightweight, free-flying glider aircraft known as a paraglider. Participants, called paragliders or pilots, are suspended from a harness beneath the wing and use the natural elements to stay aloft.                <br> <br>
                Paragliders are foot-launched and typically take off from hills or mountains. The pilot runs or takes a few steps to inflate the wing, allowing it to catch the wind and lift into the air. Once airborne, the pilot can control the direction, altitude, and speed by manipulating the suspension lines and brakes.            </p>

                Surfing is a water sport in which individuals, known as surfers, ride on the face of breaking ocean waves while standing or lying on a surfboard. Surfers use their skills to navigate the waves, perform maneuvers, and ride the surf for the thrill and enjoyment of the sport.                <br> <br>
                Key elements of surfing include paddling out to where waves are breaking, timing the paddle and the push to catch a wave, and then riding the wave back to shore. Surfers often ride different types of waves, and the sport can vary from small, gentle waves suitable for beginners to large, powerful waves that challenge even the most experienced surfers.            </p>
